# Barcelona-Rent-Cadastral-Regression
Extracting two datasets from web, analysing, preprocessing and make prediction with a Linear Regression model using ScikitLearn and Pandas.

The project goes through three steps:
 - Web Scrapping, for extract the datasets ids to query the data from the Barcelona council website.
 - Analysing and Preprocessing, for choose the desired columns, fill the N/A values and prepare the data structure for the ML model.
 - Machine Learning, where I train the model, make predictions and evaluate the accurancing of the results.
