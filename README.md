# Barcelona-Rent-Cadastral-Regression
Extracting a rent and cadastral datasets, analyse and preprocess the data and make prediction with a Linear Regression model using ScikitLearn and Pandas.

The project goes through three steps:
 - Web Scraping, for extract the datasets ids to query the data from the Barcelona council website.
 - Analysing and Preprocessing, for choose the desired columns, fill the N/A values and prepare the data structure for the ML model.
 - Machine Learning, where I train the model, make predictions and evaluate the accurancing of the results.

Datasets to use:
- Average monthly rent (€/month) and per surface (€/m2 per month) of the city of Barcelona.
- Cadastral positions according to the owner's type of the city of Barcelona.
